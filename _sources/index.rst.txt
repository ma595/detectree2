==========

`Detectree2 <https://github.com/PatBall1/detectree2>`_, based on the `Detectron2 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2>`_ 
Mask R-CNN architecture, locates trees in aerial images. 
It has been designed to delineate trees in challenging dense tropical forests for a range of 
ecological applications.  Here is an example image of the predictions made by Mask R-CNN.
