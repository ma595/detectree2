Tutorial
========

A tutorial for:

1. preparing data
2. training models
3. evaluating model performance
4. making landscape level predictions

Before getting started ensure detectree2 is installed either through

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $pip install detectree2

or

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $conda install detectree2 -c conda-forge

To train a model you will need an orthomosaic (as ``<orthmosaic.tif``) and

corresponding tree crown polgons that are readable by Geopandas
(e.g. ``<crowns_polygon>.gpkg``, ``<crowns_polygon>.shp``). For the best
results, manual crowns should be supplied as dense clusters rather than
sparsely scattered across in the landscape


If you would just like to make predictions on an orthomosaic with a pre-trained
model from the ``model_garden``, skip to part 4.


1. Preparing data
-----------------

An example of the recommended file structure when training a new model is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   ├── Danum                                       (site directory)
   │   ├── rgb
   │   │   └── Dan_2014_RGB_project_to_CHM.tif     (RGB orthomosaic in local UTM CRS)
   │   └── crowns
   │       └── Danum.gpkg                          (Crown polygons readable by geopandas e.g. Geopackage, shapefile)
   │ 
   └── Paracou                                     (site directory)
       ├── rgb                                     
       │   ├── Paracou_RGB_2016_10cm.tif           (RGB orthomosaic in local UTM CRS)
       │   └── Paracou_RGB_2019.tif                (RGB orthomosaic in local UTM CRS)
       └── crowns
           └── UpdatedCrowns8.gpkg                 (Crown polygons readable by geopandas e.g. Geopackage, shapefile)

Here we have two site available to train on. Multiple site directories can be 
included in the training and testing phase but only a single site directory is 
required.
If available, several RGB orthomosaics can be included in a single site
directory (see e.g ``Paracou -> RGB``).

We will call functions to from ``detectree2``'s' tiling and training modules.

.. code-block:: python
   
   from detectree2.preprocessing.tiling import tile_data_train, to_traintest_folders
   from detectree2.models.train import register_train_data, MyTrainer, setup_cfg
   import rasterio
   import geopandas as gpd

Set up the paths for the orthomosaic and corresponding manual crown data.

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Set up input paths
   site_path = "/content/drive/Shareddrives/detectree2/data/Paracou"
   img_path = site_path + "/rgb/2016/Paracou_RGB_2016_10cm.tif"
   crown_path = site_path + "/crowns/220619_AllSpLabelled.gpkg"

   out_dir = site_path + '/tiles/'

   # Read in the tiff file
   data = rasterio.open(img_path)
   
   # Read in crowns (then filter by an attribute?)
   crowns = gpd.read_file(crown_path)
   crowns = crowns.to_crs(data.crs.data)

Set up the tiling parameters.

The tile size will depend on:
- The resolution of your imagery

.. code-block:: python

   # Set tiling parameters
   buffer = 30
   tile_width = 40
   tile_height = 40
   threshold = 0.6


Next we tile the data

.. code-block:: python
   
   tile_data_train(data, out_dir, buffer, tile_width, tile_height, crowns, threshold)


Send geojsons to train folder (with sub-folders for k-fold cross validation)
 and test folder. 
The approximate proportion of data to reserve for testing.
Automatically removes training tiles that overlap with test tiles, ensuring
spatial separation 

.. code-block:: python
   
   to_traintest_folders(data_folder, out_dir, test_frac=0.15, folds=5)

Are data is now tiled and partitioned for training and model evaluation

.. code-block:: bash
   
   └── Danum                                       (site directory)
       ├── rgb
       │   └── Dan_2014_RGB_project_to_CHM.tif     (RGB orthomosaic in local UTM CRS)
       ├── crowns
       │   └── Danum.gpkg
       └── tiles                                   (tile directory)
           ├── train
           │   ├── fold_1                          (train fold folder)
           │   ├── fold_2                          (train fold folder)
           │   └── ...
           └── test                                (test data folder)
 

2. Training a model
-------------------

Register the training data. It is possible to set a validation fold for model
evaluation

.. code-block:: python
   
   train_location = "/content/drive/Shareddrives/detectree2/data/Paracou/tiles/train/"
   register_train_data(train_location, "Paracou", val_fold)


Supply the ``base_model`` from Detectron2's  ``model_zoo``

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Set the base (pre-trained) model from the detectron2 model_zoo
   base_model = "COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_101_FPN_3x.yaml"
      
   # trained_model = "/content/drive/Shareddrives/detectree2/models/220629_ParacouSepilokDanum_JB.pth"
   trains = ("Paracou_train", "Paracou2019_train", "ParacouUAV_train", "Danum_train", "SepilokEast_train", "SepilokWest_train")
   tests = ("Paracou_val", "Paracou2019_val", "ParacouUAV_val", "Danum_val", "SepilokEast_val", "SepilokWest_val")
   
   #trains = ("Paracou_train", "Paracou2019_train")
   #tests = ("Paracou_val", "Paracou2019_val")
   out_dir = "/content/drive/Shareddrives/detectree2/220809_train_outputs"
   
   cfg = setup_cfg(base_model, trains, tests, workers = 4, eval_period=100, max_iter=3000, out_dir=out_dir) # update_model arg can be used to load in trained  model
